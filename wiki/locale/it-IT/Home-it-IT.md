ASF is a Steam power tool, which allows you to automate certain activities and otherwise manage many of your Steam accounts at the same time.

While it's primary purpose was and remains farming Steam trading cards, nowadays it can do much more for you, such as:
- Claiming free licenses and Steam points shop items, through `addlicense` and `redeempoints` **[commands](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Commands)**.
- Accepting 2FA confirmations and generating codes, through **[ASF 2FA](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Two-factor-authentication)** module.
- Passively or actively taking part in 1:1 STM trading in order to finish your Steam sets (badges), through **[`SteamTradeMatcher`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#tradingpreferences)** and **[`MatchActively`](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Configuration#tradingpreferences)** configuration properties.
- Making use of unique **[plugins system](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/Plugins)**, which allows other developers to enhance ASF with infinite superpowers.
